# Well-being Helper

This goal of this Chrome extesnion is reduce stressors from your browsing experince. The initial concept was to create a meditation extension with different durations and different types of meditation. However, due to technical limitations, the extension shifted to subtly replace some stressful keywords from news sites to something a little more fun. The extension still includes one meditation option through the popup. When you click start a blur overlay will be applied to the active tap and a voice clip of 3 minutes guided meditation automatically start. You also have the option to pause it the voice clip and remove the blur. In order to restart the meditaion, the tap has to be refreshed.
