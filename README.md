# Well-being Helper

The goal of this Chrome extension is to reduce stressors from your browsing experience. The initial concept was to create a meditation extension with different durations and different types of meditation. However, due to technical limitations, the extension shifted to subtly replace some stressful keywords from news sites with something a little less stressful so you can have a chuckle while reading some dooming articles. The extension still includes one meditation option through the popup. When you click the Start button a blur overlay will be applied to the active tap and a voice clip of 3 minutes guided meditation automatically starts. You also have the option to pause the voice clip and remove the blur. In order to restart the meditation, the tap has to be refreshed.
